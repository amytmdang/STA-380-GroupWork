#Exploratory Analysis: Green Buildings

```{r}
green = read.csv('greenbuildings.csv', header = T)
attach(green)

#correlation matrix
correlated = cor(green, method = c("pearson"))
correlated
```


```{r}
med = median(Rent)
hist(Rent)
abline(v = med, col = 2, lwd = 2)
```

The rent is highly skewed, with a couple of extreme outliers. 

```{r}
plot(cluster_rent, Rent)
```


```{r}
plot(Electricity_Costs, Rent)
```

Rent is highly correlated with Electricity cost (0.39166) and cluster_rent(0.759). Understandably, cluster_rent is highly and closely correlated with rent. However, is electricity cost still highly correlated when a unit pays for utilities separately?

##plot greens/not greens to age, rent, etc.

```{r}
#filter green so only net = 1 rows are left
netgreen = green[net == '1',]
plot(netgreen$Electricity_Costs, netgreen$Rent)
```

```{r}
cor(netgreen$Electricity_Costs, netgreen$Rent)
```

Correlation between Electricity Costs and Rent dropped to 0.29545 for units where net = 1, or where residents paid for utilities themselves.

```{r}
netgreen2 = green[net != '1',]
plot(netgreen2$Electricity_Costs, netgreen2$Rent)
```

```{r}
cor(netgreen2$Electricity_Costs, netgreen2$Rent)
```
##Correlation grew to 0.4012, SOOO IDK.

##Compare price of areas & price of new buildings??

#Bootstrapping
```{r}
