#Probability Part A

Event T = person is truthfull clicker

Event A = answered yes in survey

Goal: find the proportion of truthfull clickers who answered yes

$P(A) = P(A|T)*P(T) + P(A|T')*P(T')$

$0.65 = P(A|T)*(0.7) + (0.5)*(0.3)$

$P(A|T) = 0.7143$

**71.43% of truthfull clickers answered yes to the survey.**

#Probability Part B

![Part B](Stats/Exercise 1/PartB.png) 

Event A = person actually has the disease

Event T = person tests positive for the disease

<br>
*First find $P(T)$ using Law of Total Probability *

$P(T) = P(T|A)*P(A) + P(T|A')*P(A')$

$P(T) = (0.993)*(0.000025) + (0.0001)*(0.999975)$

$P(T) = 0.0001248225$

<br>
*Now find $P(A|T)$ using Bayes Theorem*

$P(A|T) = \frac{P(A)*P(T|A)}{P(T)}$ 

$P(A|T) = \frac{(0.993)*(0.000025)}{0.0001248225}$

$P(A|T) = 0.19888$

**After a positive test result, there is still only a 20% chance a person has the disease. Implementing this testing universally will lead to a lot of false positives. These people will need to be retested (possibly multiple times) to confirm the disease, or go through different tests that are more conclusive.**

#Exploratory Analysis: Green Buildings

```{r}
green = read.csv('greenbuildings.csv', header = T)
attach(green)

#correlation matrix
correlated = cor(green, method = c("pearson"))
correlated
```


```{r}
med = median(Rent)
hist(Rent)
abline(v = med, col = 2, lwd = 2)
```

The rent is highly skewed, with a couple of extreme outliers. 

```{r}
plot(cluster_rent, Rent)
```


```{r}
plot(Electricity_Costs, Rent)
```

Rent is highly correlated with Electricity cost (0.39166) and cluster_rent(0.759). Understandably, cluster_rent is highly and closely correlated with rent. However, is electricity cost still highly correlated when a unit pays for utilities separately?

##plot greens/not greens to age, rent, etc.

```{r}
#filter green so only net = 1 rows are left
netgreen = green[net == '1',]
plot(netgreen$Electricity_Costs, netgreen$Rent)
```

```{r}
cor(netgreen$Electricity_Costs, netgreen$Rent)
```

Correlation between Electricity Costs and Rent dropped to 0.29545 for units where net = 1, or where residents paid for utilities themselves.

```{r}
netgreen2 = green[net != '1',]
plot(netgreen2$Electricity_Costs, netgreen2$Rent)
```

```{r}
cor(netgreen2$Electricity_Costs, netgreen2$Rent)
```
##Correlation grew to 0.4012, SOOO IDK.

##Compare price of areas & price of new buildings??

#Bootstrapping
```{r}

```
